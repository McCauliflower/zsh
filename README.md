Setup for using a shared zshrc between an admin and a non admin account.

Need to install a font that has powerline glyphs for this setup to work properly, and then add it through the iterm GUI along with checking the 'powerline glyphs' checkbox.

file names obviously need to be updated to .zshrc in their respective folders as well.
